With the start of the **Season 3** we want to present **Realms Reborn** update.

Some of the new exciting features include:
- 2 new major dimensions that some of you might remember from past. Those being Twilight Forest and The Aether
- Complete overhaul of terrain generation for the server
- Many new structures for you to find and explore
- MAGIC! Yes we added magic. Now you can do unspeakable things.
- Mythical creatures including Dragons. Now you can fight them, steal their stuff or even raise your own!
- Skill tree. You can specialize into an Enchanter to work with magic, a soldier to be master of combat or even assassin to deal "troublesome" people.
- Complete overhaul of The End and Nether including new biomes, structures and mobs.

We are happy for all of your support and hope that you will enjoy this new season!
